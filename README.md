## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, as well as adding table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary

### Drawback

One drawback of this webpage is that for each field you must type in exactly how it is written on the page. For example, if you typed "El Cajon" above instead of "el cajon" you would not get any results.

### Recommendations

Two additional recommendations for further development:
1. Add a button to clear all of the filters that were created.
2. Add drop down lists for each field that include all of the possible filters.
